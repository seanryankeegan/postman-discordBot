# postman-discordBot
This repo contains sample code for creating a discord bot that triggers a Postman monitor run.

In a new [repl.it](repl.it) environment (or wherever you'd like to host your own code), you can copy/paste the code from this repo to create a simple Discord Bot that gets user stats for Fortnite players. The bot looks for a prefix of `!fn` to trigger it, followed by the  params: `command` `<Fortnite username>`. 

Ex: `!fn user Ninja` should return in Discord: 
>The user Ninja has 133868 kills!

To have a fully functioning bot, you also need to follow the steps of this public workspace in Postman.
